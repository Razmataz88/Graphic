/*
 * File:	mainwindow.cpp
 * Author:	Rachel Bood
 * Date:	January 25, 2015.
 * Version:	1.35
 *
 * Purpose:	Implement the main window and functions called from there.
 *
 * Modification history:
 * Jan 25, 2016 (JD V1.2):
 *  (a) Don't include TIFF and JPEG as file types to make the list shorter;
 *	assume (!) that the list also includes TIF and JPG.
 *  (b) TikZ: only output edge label font size if there is an edge label.
 *  (c) TikZ: only output edge thickness to ET_PREC_TIKZ digits.
 *  (d) TikZ: Only output vertex positions to VP_PREC_TIKZ digits.
 *  (e) TikZ: Merge the two (currently identical) code branches for drawing
 *	edges.
 *  (f) Factored out the "default" features in
 *	on_graphType_ComboBox_currentIndexChanged()) while fixing a
 *	bug where one or two weren't set when they should be.
 *  (g) Changed the minimum number of nodes to 1 for known graph types;
 *	tweaked some other similar parameters as well.
 *	For graphs read in from .grphc files, only display the UI control
 *	that (currently) do anything.
 *  (h) Changed some of the widget labels for the different types of
 *	graphs in on_graphType_ComboBox_currentIndexChanged().
 *  (i) Re-ordered file type drop-down list so to put the "text" outputs
 *	at the top.
 * Feb 3, 2016 (JD V1.3)
 *  (a) Removed "GraphSettings.h" since it is not used.
 *  (b) Minor formatting cleanups.
 *  (c) Changed "Grapha" to "Graphic".
 * Oct 11, 2019 (JD V1.4)
 *  (a) Allow blank lines and comments ([ \t]*#.*) in .grphc files.
 *  (b) Add some comments.  Reformat a bit.  Improve debug stmts.
 *  (c) Output a more informative and human-readable .grhpc file.
 *      Output the information as we compute it, rather than slowly
 *      constructing two big honkin' strings piece by piece and
 *	then outputting them.
 *  (d) Check for some error conditions and pop up a QErrorMessage in
 *      such cases.
 * Oct 13, 2019 (JD V1.5)
 *  (a) Before this version, node labels and corresponding font sizes
 *	were not stored in the .grphc file.  Go figure.
 *  (b) Look up TikZ-known colours (for TikZ output) and use those
 *	names rather than defining new colours for every coloured item.
 *  (c) When saving the graph, only do Linux-specific filename checks
 *	*after* confirming the selected filename is non-null.
 *  (d) Added some error checking when selecting files as possible
 *      graph-ic files, as well as checking contents of a graph-ic file.
 *  (e) Since node.{h,cpp} have been updated to allow superscripts as
 *	well as subscripts, and this allows the "edit" function to change
 *	vertex labels with subs/supers, the TikZ export has been changed
 *	to add '^{}' iff there is no '^' in the label.  This adds a
 *	spurious (but apparently harmless) empty superscript to labels
 *	which have neither sub nor super.
 *  (f) Added a number of function comments.
 * Oct 16, 2019 (JD V1.6)
 *  (a) When creating .grphc file, center graph on (0,0) so that when
 *      it is read back in it is centered (and thus accessible) in the
 *	preview pane.  Ditto
 *  (b) Output coords (to .grphc file) using a %.<VP_PREC_GRPHC>f
 *	format, rather than the default %6g format, to avoid numbers
 *	like -5.68434e-14 (DAMHIKT) in the output file.
 * Oct 16, 2019 (JD V1.7)
 *  (a) The original code was outputting (TikZ case) too many edge
 *      colour definitions, and in some cases they could be wrong.
 *	Fix that, and also add in the "well known colour" stuff from
 *	the nodes, as described in V1.5(b) above.
 *  (b) Only output the edge label and size if there is one.
 *  (c) Read edges from .grphc file with and without label info.
 * Nov 10, 2019 (JD V1.8)
 *  (a) Output the label font size before label so that a space before the
 *      label doesn't need to be trimmed.
 * Nov 10, 2019 (JD V1.9)
 *  (a) Fix apparently-erroneous use of logicalDotsPerInchX in the Y
 *	part of Create_Graph() (called in generate_Graph()).
 *  (b) Add some comments and some qDebug() statements.
 *  (c) Rename getWeightLabelSize() -> getLabelSize().
 *  (d) Rename "Weight" to "Label" for edge function names.
 *  (e) Do not call style_Graph() in generate_Graph() for "library"
 *	graphs, since doing so removes colour and size info.  This is
 *	only a partial fix to the problem, since this mod takes away
 *	the ability to style a library graph.  style_Graph() needs to
 *	be entirely rethought.
 *  (f) Add the rest of the "named" colours to lookupColour().
 *  (g) Remove a bunch of uninteresting output file types from the
 *	save dialog menu.
 * Nov 16, 2019 (JD V1.10)
 *  (a) Refactor save_graph() because it is unwieldy large
 *	into itself + saveEdgelist() (step 1 of many!).
 *  (b) Formatting tweaks.
 * Nov 17, 2019 (JD V1.11)
 *  (a) Move lookupColour() above where it is used and make it a
 *	non-class function.
 * Nov 18, 2019 (JD V1.12)
 *  (a) Fixed the edit window so that it looks nicer and behaves
 *	(vis-a-vis vertical spacing) much nicer (changes in
 *	on_tabWidget_currentChanged()).
 *	Modify code which outputs "Edit Graph" tab to make the Label
 *	box wider, since that is the one which needs the space (at
 *	least when using sub- or superscripts).
 *	Also put stretch at the bottom so that the layout manager
 *	doesn't distribute extra space in ugly places.
 *  (b) Add connections between a node (or edge) and its label in the
 *	edit tab, so that when a node (or edge) is deleted (in delete
 *	mode) the label in its row in the Edit Graph tab is also
 *	deleted.  (Everything else used to go, may as well do that
 *	too.)
 *  (c) Change "weight" to "label" in .grphc output edge comment.
 *  (d) Comment & formatting tweaking.
 * Nov 19, 2019 (JD V1.13)
 *  (a) Factor out saveTikZ() from save_Graph().
 *  (b) Add findDefaults() as a first step to improving the TikZ
 *	output (which will set default styles at the top of each graph
 *	and only output differences for nodes/edges that are different).
 * Nov 24, 2019 (JD V1.14)
 *  (a) Add a call on_graphType_ComboBox_currentIndexChanged(-1) the
 *      mainwindow constructor to initialize the "Create Graph" pane
 *	to a self-consistent shape.  Modify on_graphType_...() to not
 *	whine when its arg is < 0.
 * Nov 28, 2019 (JD V1.15)
 *  (a) Add dumpTikZ() and dumpGraphIc() functions and shortcuts (^T
 *	and ^G) to call them.  dumpGraphIc() not yet implemented.
 *  (b) findDefaults(): changed default node diameter from 0.2 to
 *	(qreal)0.2 to correctly match the data type.  Changed the
 *	floats to qreals in the hashes for the same reason.
 *      Also only change struct values from the initial defaults if
 *	there were actually observations in the corresponding hash table.
 *  (c) Improve saveTikZ() so that "nicer" TikZ code is output.
 *      Specifically, output default styles for nodes, edge lines and
 *	edge labels and when outputting individual nodes and edges
 *	only specify differences from the defaults.
 *	Also output things as we go, rather than creating a big
 *	honkin' string and outputting it at the end (can you say O(n^2)?).
 * Nov 28, 2019 (JD V1.16)
 *  (a) Factor out saveGraphIc() from save_Graph().
 *      Use this to implement dumpGraphIc().
 * Nov 29, 2019 (JD V1.17)
 *  (a) Rename "none" mode to "drag" mode, for less confusion.
 * Dec 1, 2019 (JD V1.18)
 *  (a) Add qDeb() / DEBUG stuff.
 *  (b) Print out more screen resolution & size info.
 *  (c) Add comments, minor code clean-ups.
 * Dec 6, 2019 (JD V1.19)
 *  (a) Rename generate_Freestyle_{Nodes,Edges} to {node,edge}ParamsUpdated
 *      to better reflect what those functions do.
 *  (b) Modify generate_Graph(), and the related connect() calls, to
 *	hand a parameter to generate_Graph() so that it knows which
 *	widget's change caused it to be called.  This is the first
 *	step of fixing things so that specific features of library
 *	graphs can be styled without applying all styles, which
 *	otherwise destroys much of the content of a library graph.
 *  (c) Bug fix: nodeParamsUpdated() now passes the NodeLabelSize to
 *	ui->canvas->setUpNodeParams() where it should, not the nodeSize.
 *  (d) Clean up debug outputs a bit.  Improve some comments.
 * Dec 9, 2019 (JD V1.20)
 *  (a) Various comment and debug changes.
 *  (b) Change generate_Graph() to not pass height and width into to
 *	PreView::Create_Graph().  This is part of a large set of
 *	changes which will eventually allow library graphs to be styled.
 *  (c) Update call sequence to PV::Style_graph() as per changes there.
 *  (d) Obsessively re-order the cases in
 *	on_graphType_ComboBox_currentIndexChanged().
 *	Also set more constraints on the spinboxes so that we can't
 *	call generate_...() functions with meaningless parameters.
 *	Show both width and height for Dutch Windmill, in case someone
 *	wants one with non-unit aspect ratio.
 *  (e) Add on_numOfNodes1_valueChanged() to follow the actions of
 *	on_numOfNodes2_valueChanged() to avoid inconsistent parameters
 *	when numOfNodes1 is changed.
 * Dec 12, 2019 (JD V1.21)
 *  (a) Save the screen DPI in a couple of static global vars & get it
 *	over with, rather than repeatedly calling the Qt functions.
 *  (b) Modify saveGraphIc() so that the coords in the .grphc file are
 *	in inches, not in pixels.  (It should have been this way from
 *	day 1!)
 *  (c) Allow commas in labels.
 *  (d) Close the file descriptor upon discovering an error when
 *      reading a .grphc file.
 *  (e) (Re-)Implement the ability to style library graphs (with
 *	changes to preview.cpp).  As of this version, the graph
 *	drawing widgets visible when a library graph is chosen do not
 *	have values related to the graph in the preview window.  This
 *	needs to be dealt with in the fullness of time.
 *  (f) Show nodeLabel2 iff showing numOfNodes2.
 *  (g) The usual collection of debug statement improvements.
 * Dec 15, 2019 (JD V1.22)
 *  (a) Modify on_graphType_ComboBox_currentIndexChanged() so that
 *	Prism gets the same treatment as Antiprism, vis-a-vis the
 *	behaviour of ui->numOfNodes1.
 * Dec 15, 2019 (JD V1.23)
 *  (a) Replace font.setPixelSize() (which is a device-dependent
 *	thing) with font.setPointSize() (which is device-INdependent).
 *	This makes the fonts on Linux show up at a reasonable size
 *	even without env QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=1 and things look
 *	fine on macos as well.
 *  (b) Replace a bunch of printf()s with qDebu(); delete a number of others.
 * May 11, 2020 (IC V1.24)
 *  (a) Changed the logical DPI variables to use physical DPI to correct
 * 	scaling issues. (Only reliable with Qt V5.14.2 or higher)
 * May 12, 2020 (IC V1.25)
 *  (a) Removed certain labels that were unnecessary after redesigning the ui.
 * May 15, 2020 (IC V1.26)
 *  (a) Modified set_Font_Sizes() to be more readable and flexible if we decide
 *	to change font (sizes) at a later date.
 * May 19, 2020 (IC V1.27)
 *  (a) Updated set_Font_Sizes() to use embeded font "arimo" as default font.
 * May 25, 2020 (IC V1.28)
 *  (a) Removed setKeyStatusLabel() in favour of tooltips for each mode.
 *  (b) Added widget NumLabelStart which allows the user to start numbering
 *	nodes at a specified value instead of always 0.
 * May 28, 2020 (IC V1.29)
 *  (a) Modified save_Graph() to use a white background for JPEG files.
 * June 6, 2020 (IC V1.30)
 *  (a) Added set_Interface_Sizes() to fix sizing issues on monitors with
 *      different DPIs.
 * June 9, 2020 (IC V1.31)
 *  (a) Converted the node and edge label size doublespinboxes into
 *      regular spinboxes and updated any relevant connect statements.
 * June 10, 2020 (IC V1.32)
 *  (a) Added QSettings to save the window size on exit and load the size
 *      on startup. See saveSettings() and loadSettings()
 *  (b) Reimplemented closeEvent() to accommodate QSettings and prompt user to
 *      save graph if any exists on the canvas.
 *  (c) Added code to saveGraph() that supports saving default background
 *      colour of saved images. WIP
 * June 17, 2020 (IC V1.33)
 *  (a) Updated on_tabWidget_currentChanged() to display merged graphs under a
 *      single set of headers as well as delete those headers if the graph is
 *      deleted.
 * June 19, 2020 (IC V1.34)
 *  (a) Added multiple slots and appropriate connections for updating edit tab
 *      when graphs/nodes/edges are created.
 * June 26, 2020 (IC V1.35)
 *  (a) Update some connections to take a node or edge param.
 *  (b) When getting a colour ensure that getColor() returned a valid color.
 *  (c) Rename on_tabWidget_currentChanged(int) to updateEditTab(int).
 *      Do some UI tweaking there.
 *  (d) Implement addGraphToEditTab(), addNodeToEditTab() and
 *      addEdgeToEditTab().

 *		red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, yellow, black,
 *		gray (128,128, 128), darkgray (64,64,64),
 *		lightgray (191,191,191), brown (191,128,64), lime (191,255,0),
