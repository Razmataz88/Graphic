The web page http://graph-drawing.acadiau.ca/ should have links to
pre-compiled versions of this software for various operating systems.
If you don't find one that works for you, or if you prefer to compile
from source, instructions which may get you going are found below.

To compile (and optionally install) Graphic on Linux:
-----------------------------------------------------
0. Copy down the source files found here.
1. Install the Qt5 package for your version of Linux
   -> you must install the development tools, so if you have a choice
      to just select a "run-time" package, don't pick that one
2. Run
      qmake-qt5
   (or try plain  qmake  if your distro doesn't have qmake-qt5)
3. Assuming that is all good, run
      make
   or optionally, if you want to keep many of your CPUs busy
      make -j 8
   On a fast-ish CPU the latter should finish in 10 or 15 seconds.
4. The executable is the program "Graphic" in this directory.
   You can "install" it by copying it to the directory of your choice,
   such as
      /usr/local/bin
   or
      $HOME/bin


To compile (and optionally install) Graphic on MacOS:
-----------------------------------------------------
0. Copy down the source files found here.
1. Install Qt5
   -> you must install the Qt development tools, not just the run-time support.
2. Run
      qmake
3. Clean up old versions of files:
      make clean ; rm -rf Graphic.app graphic.dmg
4. Assuming that is all good, run
      make
   or optionally, if you want to keep many of your CPUs busy
      make -j 8
   On a fast-ish CPU the latter should finish in 10 or 15 seconds.
5. The executable is the program "Graphic" in the directory
      Graphic.app/Contents/MacOS
   If you wish, you can create a .dmg file with the command
      macdeployqt graphic.app -dmg
   which should create "graphic.dmg" in this directory.



-----------------------------------------------------

Other OSes:

I have no other OSes on any of my computers with which to compile
Graphic.  If you compile the sources for another OS and wish to share
your knowledge, please e-mail me (Jim Diamond) the details of what you
did.  (See the e-mail link found at http://graph-drawing.acadiau.ca/.)
